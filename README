Slow-released : Demonstrator for slow HTTP POST denial of service

During POST, web servers check HTTP header attribute "Content-Length" value.
Slow web clients (rnis, 56k, 3G) send data with small burst of data. So they perform
multiple post request to send large amount of file. Web servers keep open the tcp
connexion for theim long enough to finish the transmission.
Problem : what happens if i send one byte and do not send any additionnal data with
a wrong length value. It is what this soft show. It can perform slow released V2, aka
sending one more byte juste before the webserver timeout value for inactive link, to
keep it open. It is a DDOS attack for poor.
